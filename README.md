# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge I am creating a visual map representation of United States Geological Survey(USGS). The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. I will use All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days dataset.

Using Leaflet, I created a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

Markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

Popups provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

Legend provides context for map data.

In this challenge I used Leaflet and D3 libraries. Languanges used are HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
